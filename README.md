# Compatibility Standard

## Abstract

The [Compatibility Standard](https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/) describes a collection of non-standard (and often vendor-prefixed) CSS properties and DOM APIs that web browsers need to support for compatibility with the de facto web.

## Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please read and
respect the [WHATWG Code of Conduct](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct).
