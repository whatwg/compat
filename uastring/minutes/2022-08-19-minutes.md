### Blink Intent to Extend Experiment: User-Agent Reduction Origin Trial

* https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/jjGeFtHhak4/m/oZTrYykHAwAJ
* Mike says:
  * We would like to extend the User-Agent Reduction OT again, from M104 to M106 (inclusive).
  * Sites started testing late. Not due to known breakage.

* Questions:
  * If the OT is extended to M106, is the phase 5 rollout still planned for M107?
    * M107 is still the plan.

* Desktop: Phase 5 we change the `<platform>` and `<oscpu>` tokens from their platform-defined values to the relevant `<unifiedPlatform>` token value (which will never change).

* Android: In Phase 6, we change the `<deviceModel>` token to “K” and change the `<androidVersion>` token to a static “10” string.

### UA-CH

  * Search for “clienthintsua” to find `FullVersion`, deprecated in favor of `fullVersionList`.
    * MDN docs
    * ClientHintsUAFullVersionList @ 16.4800%
      * Usage climbed in Feb-Mar, probably due to some analytics or fingerprinting script.

* ClientHintsUAFullVersion @ 16.4501%
  * Usage spiked in Jan-Feb, probably due to some analytics or fingerprinting script. Interesting that FullVersion usage spiked before FullVersionList.
