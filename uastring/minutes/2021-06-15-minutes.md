# [Minutes] UA String Reduction - 2021-06-05

## Attendees:

* Karl Dubost, Mozilla
* Mike Taylor, Google

## Minutes

### Administrivia
mike: Where do we keep the minutes?

karl: On the [repo](https://github.com/whatwg/compat/blob/main/uastring/minutes)

## What should be working on

karl: [@cpeterso](https://github.com/cpeterso) has created a document for Firefox (not public yet), where he's documenting pros and cons of UA freezing/reduction. A lot of these things could be generalized beyond Mozilla. There are things that could be copied and used

mike: Should we start with list of pro/cons? or should we start documenting user agent structure?

karl: Probably we should do both.Understanding the "theory" of UA string. There are a lot of things in common in there, to the point you wonder why it's still there, for example `Mozilla/5.0`. This is worth being documented. We could also document the things you had done in firefox -- a bit of the history and evolution (there is a public google doc somewhere)

mike: I was getting the UA client hints ready for the TAG, and there's a good [explainer in there](https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints#use-cases). It has information on what people use. The origin was to motivate what API could be built with regards to this information. It's very similar to the blog post karl wrote [about user agent detection cases](https://www.otsukare.info/2014/03/31/ua-detection-use-cases). We can take the best pieces of this and make sure everything is covered

mike: we can meet again in a couple of weeks. Let's work on this. We can invite people to participate. let's use markdown files to start. We can consolidate later.

karl: **I will start with UA detection use cases**

mike: **I will start with structure of user agent strings.**
