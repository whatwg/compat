# [Minutes] UA String Reduction - 2023-02-24

## Attendees:

* Chris Peterson, Mozilla
* Mike Taylor, Google
* Raja Abdulhaq, Google

### Welcome Raja Abdulhaq!
  * He will be working on Android.

* Mike will ask John Wilander from WebKit team if he would like to join these meetings.
  * Mike didn’t do this yet. Let’s try again.

### [UA Reduction Rollout schedule](https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/#updates)
  * Jan 23rd, 2023: the Phase 5 rollout is enabled for 50% of clients on M107 and above via Finch.
  * February 7th, 2023: the Phase 5 rollout is enabled for 100% of clients on M107 and above via Finch.
  * February 21st, 2023: the Phase 6 rollout is enabled for 1% of Android clients on M110 and above via Finch.
    * Hardcoding version “Android 10” and device model “K”
    * Mike feels device model is the riskiest change because we don’t know how sites may use it.
    * will stay at 1% for four+ weeks
  * Mozilla is watching how the UA reduction is going and will follow later.
  * How will UA reduction impact WebView?
    * Victor (and Raja?) will investigate.
    * UA reduction rollout have not included WebView yet.
    * WebView didn’t have UA-CH yet, but it now supports client hints. We’re looking into turning on UA-CH there as well, but no concrete plans yet.

### Webcompat bugs: sites are detecting Firefox “rv:110” as IE11 (“rv:11”).
  * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1805967 
  * RESOLVED
  * Sites think Firefox’s “rv:11” means IE11.
  * New “rv:109” webcompat bug:
  * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1817530 
  * An anti-spam script is complaining the Firefox’s “rv:109” and “Firefox/110”+ versions doesn’t match.
  * Firefox is temporarily freezing its UA’s “rv:NNN” at “rv:109” until version “rv:120” (Sep 2023: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1806690 )
  * Mike blogged about this at https://miketaylr.com/posts/2022/12/how-the-IE-11-ua-string-broke-sites-in-firefox.html 

### UA-CH
  * [chris] I’m still prototyping the navigator.userAgentData API for Firefox in my spare time.
    * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1750143 
    * Actually made a tiny bit of progress over the holidays!
  * Chrome’s UA-CH implementation exposes Linux kernel version
    * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1381304
    * Mike will fix to return an empty string (per the spec):
    * https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4005183 
    * Mike will work with Raja to write intents and probably land in Q1, pending approvals.
  * Mike to take an AI to file a bug / investigate Google Business sites (like https://steakhouse-319.business.site/) using the deprecated `uaFullVersion`.
    * Mike is in discussion with some internal teams to migrate from deprecated FullVersion to Full-Version-List.
    * Victor on Mike’s team will try to remove FullVersion next year. He will try to find whoever runs the “business.site” infrastructure as well. Will follow up on this next time.
    * Search for “clienthintsua” to find `FullVersion`, deprecated in favor of `fullVersionList`.
