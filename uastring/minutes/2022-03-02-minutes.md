* AI: Chrome folks to spend some time doing outreach in the coming weeks, before we get to Beta.
* Mike: beta 100 starts tomorrow.
* Chris: 100 nightly starts tomorrow.

### Android WebView
* Ali: We were running v100 experiments since version 97 or so, but couldn‚Äôt run it on WebView. It just hit 99 stable, so I submitted a patch to be able to start an experiment on WebView. Hopefully we‚Äôll be able to know if there‚Äôs any version concerns.
    * ‚ÄúMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.20 Safari/537.36‚Äù
* Mike: We only have a few weeks window, right?
* Ali: WebView is 100 on canary/dev, but nobody uses it really for Apps. The window is tight, but if we find some bugs we can go to the backup plan (major-in-minor).
* Mike: And maybe webview only, right?
* Chris: And 99.100.0.0 isn‚Äôt risk-free, right?
* Ali: yeah, we have 2 experiment arms to test 100 as well as 99.100 to see if there‚Äôs any compat bugs we‚Äôre not aware of.
* Chris: How did you determine website breakage? Just using telemetry? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing. Not perfect, but it could be useful for some signal.
### Action items from last meeting:
* Karl will update the minutes: https://github.com/whatwg/compat/tree/main/uastring/minutes
https://github.com/whatwg/compat/blob/main/uastring/minutes/2022-02-02-minutes.md
* Karl will follow up on Hacks blog post sign-off.
* Mike will ask Milica if we can publish on 02-14.
* Chris will ask Mike Kaply about Firefox enterprise policy options.
    * Do we need to write a SUMO article about enterprise options?
        * Not at this time.
        * Mike emailed a warning about version 100 to the enterprise user mailing list and described how to set the ‚Äúnetwork.http.useragent.forceVersion‚Äù pref in an enterprise policy file.
* Mike will file an issue to include other browsers, e.g. Chromium-based browsers including Edge, Chinese browsers, Gecko-based SeaMonkey or WaterFox.

### UA reductions?
* Any compat news from Google‚Äôs Origin Trial testing?
    * Mike: so far things have been pretty good - we‚Äôre not aware of major breakage right now.
    * Ali: This OT will finish when Chrome 101 comes out - been running for 6 versions. We‚Äôre also starting a deprecation trial, which allows a site to maintain the legacy UA string until Chrome 113.
* Is Google still on track to ship reduced Chrome MINOR.BUILD.PATCH version numbers in Chrome 101 and reduced Desktop UA in Chrome 107?
    * https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/#proposed-rollout-plan
    * Mike: Yep, that‚Äôs the current plan. https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/dcTStiBZVoQ
* Mozilla is still evaluating options and timeline for Firefox UA reductions.
    * Ali: I was looking at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent/Firefox, are there future plans? Any plan to reduce things in the future?
    * Chris: I have a draft doc, we‚Äôre looking at some options. Just a question of priorities.
    * Ali: for the time being, MDN is accurate?
    * Chris: yes, up to date, but a lot of old stuff that‚Äôs less relevant.
    * Ali: for Chrome, we‚Äôre going to start with Desktop, then Mobile. Any reason we chose that order?
    * Mike: yeah, there‚Äôs some use cases in certain countries relying on device model in the UA string on mobile. So, to me it made sense to give them some more time.

### New action items:
* See you all at our next meeting on April 6.
