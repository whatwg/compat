### Version 100 testing?

* No known showstoppers
* No new problems from the Chrome or Firefox experiments.
* Chrome testing a mitigation that would freeze major version and increment minor version, e.g. 99.100.0.0.
* Chrome is adding an [enterprise policy to override version number](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1287531).
* Firefox’s mitigation plan to use site interventions would not help with enterprises with broken intranet sites.
    * Can we add a pref to freeze Firefox version at 99?
        * example pref with a list of domains: `dom.keyboardevent.keypress.hack.use_legacy_keycode_and_charcode`
    * `general.useragent.override` pref
* Ask Mike Kaply about enterprise policy options?
    * [Mozilla policy templates can set prefs.](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md#preferences)
* Do we need to write a SUMO article about enterprise options?

### draft: User-Agent string patterns

* Mike landed the [draft](https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/#ua-string-section)
* File [issues](https://github.com/whatwg/compat/issues)
* Next steps?
    * Mike will file an issue to include other browsers, e.g. Chromium-based browsers including Edge and ChromeOS, VR browsers, Chinese browsers, Gecko-based SeaMonkey or WaterFox.
    * Mike will address doc issues filed.
