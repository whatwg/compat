# [Minutes] UA String Reduction - 2022-04-06

## Attendees:

* Karl Dubost, Mozilla
* Chris Peterson, Mozilla
* Mike Taylor, Google

### Version üíØ
* Chrome üíØ is now üíØ% across all channels.
    * https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/releases?platform=Windows

* Firefox 100 in beta currently. Yoohoo!
    * Release date: May 3.
    * https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/labels/version100
        * 27 Firefox version100 webcompat issues are open, atm: https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Abrowser-firefox+label%3Aversion100
        * 15 issues with sitepatch applied https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues?q=label%3Aversion100+label%3Asitepatch-applied
        * only 3 issues still require a sitepatch https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aaction-needssitepatch+label%3Aversion100
* Only a few dozen reported for now, but some concern that we didn‚Äôt learn about jQuery Reject or Yell/Duda breakage through webcompat.com issues. What unreported issues are we still missing?
* Yottaa CDN issues?
    * https://www.hannaandersson.com/ issue https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/100779 looks like it might be a different problem.
    * Test other Yottaa customers?
    * https://www.yottaa.com/customer-stories/
    * Some of their customers are major sites (like Shopify) so we probably would have heard if they were all broken.
    * No override yet for the CDN https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/webcompat-addon/blob/896b9f911c8786f036ed85cc5caa259e06156406/src/data/ua_overrides.js#L716-L738
* Any new webcompat issues?
    * Not really
    * [jQuery Reject sites (Chrome 100 version parsing error) - Public](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uk2EiDrsuqBGFTjT5QGhliAuenzDgfZD9EXZifzzEz8/edit#gid=0)
        * about 100 sites still unfixed
        * shows an ‚Äúupgrade your browser‚Äù message to Chrome and Edge 100+
        * Mike will do the outreach for top sites only

### Next steps for Compat Standard‚Äôs UA section?
* https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/#ua-string-section
* Mike is still addressing bugs (slowly). Rewrote Safari UA section.
* When UA reductions ship, no need to describe the change. Describing the latest UA is OK.
###  UA reductions?
* Is Google still on track to ship reduced Chrome major.0.0.0 version numbers in Chrome 101?
* On track yes (see I2S).
* Schedule: https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/#proposed-rollout-plan
* Only known breakage from navigator.oscpu reduction: Netflix on Chrome OS https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1298570
* So far no breakage on identifying ‚Äú0‚Äù in minor version (fingers crossed)
* Firefox UA reductions
  * Chris has some patches to freeze OS versions and CPU architectures in Firefox UA, but Mozilla will probably wait for Chrome to ship their reductions first.

* Action items from last meeting:
    * Mike will publish minutes from Mar 2 meeting.
* New action items:
    * Mike will publish minutes from today‚Äôs Apr 6 meeting.
