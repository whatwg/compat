### Status on the work planned at the last meeting (2021-06-15 JST).[ https://github.com/whatwg/compat/blob/main/uastring/minutes/index.md](https://github.com/whatwg/compat/blob/main/uastring/minutes/index.md) (Minutes to come)

### About this meeting

* Who should we invite to this meeting?
    - **Mike asks if we can make this meeting more public.**
    - **Announce and publish a link to the Zoom room and the meeting notes? Where?**
    - Can we make a README w/ the meeting info @<https://github.com/whatwg/compat/tree/main/uastring/minutes> ?
    - Filed issue to document this:<https://github.com/whatwg/compat/issues/159>

* Is meeting monthly enough, not enough?

    We can keep it to monthly and if anything urgent comes up, let’s have ad-hoc meetings.

### How is Google’s Chrome 100 testing going?

* [jQuery Reject plugin blog post](https://miketaylr.com/posts/2021/10/jquery-reject-js-seo-hack.html)
    - 2000 sites. Few in the top 10000
    - The maintainers merged my fix and archived the repos.
    - It could probably be fixed by site interventions for legacy unmaintained websites. (easy in Firefox webcompat addons, less clear in Chrome - we don’t have these similar capabilities)
    - Maybe direct Outreach through twitter could be possible, not necessary effective.<https://twitter.com/zcorpan/status/1444272640018067459>. Worth doing for the top sites at least.
* Chrome 100 flag blog post: ​​<https://miketaylr.com/posts/2021/09/chrome-version-100-testing.html>
    - Users need to turn on a flag.
    - We want to do internal testing for Google services (to check if we can turn this on for Android as well).
    - And probably later roll out with A/B testing in the wild.
    - So far very organic accidental reports because of users activating the

### How is Mozilla’s Firefox 100 testing going?

- Oops. Firefox’s experiment was a dud due to a client bug. We will need to run another experiment in October–November.
- The fix for the experiment is already merged.
- Discussion on A/B testing approach - a controlled experiment allows you to measure if v100 users have more HTTP errors, or shorter browsing sessions, etc.
- Only looking to test on Desktop, not Android for now. Will look into Android, to see how complex it is.

### [Chrome’s UA Reduction plans](https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction)

- Official dates out:[User-Agent Reduction Origin Trial and Dates](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/09/user-agent-reduction-origin-trial-and-dates.html)
- Running an origin trial in Chrome 95–100 to allow sites to opt into reduced UA.
    - Currently only works for first-party sites.
    - (we hope) Chrome 96 will support for third-party embeds.

- Ship reduced Chrome MINOR.BUILD.PATCH version numbers (“0.0.0”) in Chrome 101 (April 2022).
    - Changes will affect User-Agent HTTP Header and navigator.userAgent and navigator.platform, and navigator.appVersion APIs.
    - For example, mobile: “Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/93.0.0.0 Safari/537.36”
        - Full version numbers and device model will be available in UA Client Hints.
    - Platform:[User-Agent Reduction](https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction#TOC-Reduced-navigator.platform-values-for-all-versions-)
        - For Firefox, currently

### Is it possible to remove Mozilla/5.0

- At some point, we wondered - can we remove this?
- Unfortunately, no. Mike says the IAB bots and spiders list sample[IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-abc-international-spiders-bots-list/) recommends UA detection code sniff for “Mozilla/” but doesn’t check “5.0”.
    - Can we remove “5.0” and leave “Mozilla/”?
- This is an anti-bot flag.
    - ![list of bot detection patterns](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AYQErO3UGkYdBUkFOHuC-kSmF9tVTCEyjITqfYP7f9myqgpEFHhaRgS3AqCzRVYIsGe8aJpkFxtQNF-wEET5lVmkgkAFBPyYdG3Qs2aC_vD8nkMt0mVhhlvcbmswtv736FW_E1NF=s0)
- Karl will look on GitHub for any code that sniffs for “5.0”.
- Does the HTTP spec say whether UA tokens must have a “/” and version number?
    - [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#header.user-agent)
    - Each product identifier consists of a name and optional version.
      - [product](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#header.user-agent) =[ token](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#imported.abnf) \["/"[ product-version](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#header.user-agent)]
      - [product-version](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#header.user-agent) =[ token](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#imported.abnf)
    - So we could send “Mozilla/5.0” or “Mozilla” but not “Mozilla/” without a product version.
    - We should create a UA explainer explaining why each UA token can or can’t be reduced.

### Next meeting is 2021-11-03.

## Action items:

- [Karl Dubost](mailto:kdubost@mozilla.com) will add a README w/ the meeting info @ <https://github.com/whatwg/compat/tree/main/uastring/minutes>.
    - TBD: What info should it include?
- Mike will ask someone on his team to help reach out to developers of sites using the broken jQuery Reject plugin.
- Mike will check if Finch experiments include Android.
- Chris will rerun the Firefox 100 experiment in October–November and include Android.
- Next time: brainstorm mitigations for version 100 problems (V1H as in Y2K).
- Karl will look on GitHub for any code that sniffs for “5.0”.
- We should create a UA explainer explaining why each UA token can or can’t be reduced.
