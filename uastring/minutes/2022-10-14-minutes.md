# [Minutes] UA String Reduction - 2022-10-14

## Attendees:

* Chris Peterson, Mozilla
* Mike Taylor, Google

* Karl suggests we invite John Wilander from WebKit team.
  * Agenda?
    * Perhaps WebKit concerns with the UA-CH API
Recent mentions of UA-CH in WebKit standards position repo:
https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/70
### UA-CH
* [chris] I’m still prototyping the navigator.userAgentData API for Firefox in my spare time. Slow progress and no ETA.
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1750143
* Use-counter data on hints:
https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/popularity
* Search for “clienthintsua” to find `FullVersion`, deprecated in favor of `fullVersionList`.
* [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorUAData/getHighEntropyValues)
* [ClientHintsUAFullVersionList](https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4079) @ 18%
  * Usage climbed in Feb-Mar, probably due to some analytics or fingerprinting script.

* [ClientHintsUAFullVersion](https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3189) @ 18%
  * Usage spiked in Jan-Feb, probably due to some analytics or fingerprinting script. Interesting that FullVersion usage spiked before FullVersionList.

* The top sites using the deprecated `FullVersion` are mostly Google Business mobile sites (like https://steakhouse-319.business.site/) and a few Wikimedia sites.
  * Mike to take an AI to file a bug / investigate.
* Mike in discussion with some internal teams to migrate to Full-Version-List. Hopefully that will drive down some usage.

### Blink Intent to Extend Experiment: User-Agent Reduction Origin Trial
  * [Proposed Rollout Plan page](https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/#proposed-rollout-plan)
  * Fully-reduced UA opt-in OT was extended from M104 to M106.
  * Phase 5 rollout still planned for M107?
  * Mike: yep, [see proposed Finch rollout here](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/kC-AeZ1fSdY/m/HhYYNDeACAAJ).
  * Begin roll-out of reduced Desktop UA string and related JS APIs (navigator.userAgent, navigator.appVersion, navigator.platform).

### Tablet UAs
* Firefox Android team is testing new UAs for tablets. Firefox currently sends a “Mobile” UA on tablets, which causes usability issues on some sites.
* We’re debating whether to:
  * Use a Linux desktop UA (like Safari on iPad)
  * Use an Android-without-Mobile UA (like Chrome on Android tablets), e.g.
`“Mozilla/5.0 (Android 10; Mobile; rv:104.0) Gecko/104.0 Firefox/104.0”`
vs `“Mozilla/5.0 (Android 10; rv:104.0) Gecko/104.0 Firefox/104.0”`
  * Android-without-Mobile gets desktop layouts on sites that sniff for “Mobile” and mobile layouts on sites that sniff for “Android”.
  * It also allows sites to detect Android and promote their native apps or other Android OS features, like app intents.
    * Use cases: launch an app or share data to clipboard/etc?
  * How can we find out how sites are using Android-without-Mobile?
    * Use a crawler script to diff content bodies returned for Android with and without Mobile?
      * https://miketaylr.github.io/arewedetectableyet/
  * Look for tablet-optimized sites?

### New action items
* Mike will ask Karl about inviting John Wilander from WebKit team to discuss UA-CH.
* Mike will file a bug about Google Business mobile sites (like https://steakhouse-319.business.site/) using deprecated `FullVersion` UA-CH.
