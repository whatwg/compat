# [Minutes] UA String Reduction - 2022-12-16

## Attendees:

* Chris Peterson, Mozilla
* Mike Taylor, Google

* Mike will ask John Wilander from WebKit team if he would like to join these meetings.
  * Mike will try to actually do this next week.

* UA Reduction Phase 5 Rollout
    * YouTube [asked for some modifications](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/kC-AeZ1fSdY/m/GPv1touOBAAJ) to the rollout schedule. We’ll consider the request, but unlikely to delay things unless sites break.
    * Update: we rolled out to 5% stable earlier than we had initially announced. But we're keeping the original schedule to get to 100%.
    * Current version is M108.
    * Mike: yep, see [proposed Finch rollout here](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/kC-AeZ1fSdY/m/HhYYNDeACAAJ).
    * After phase 5 reaches 100%, Mike will update UA compat spec to document frozen UA tokens.
  * Phase 6 rollout for Android M110 (February)
    * including device model “K”
    * Still planning on original rollout dates, hope to publish and intent to ship in early January.
* Webcompat bugs: sites are detecting Firefox “rv:110” as IE11 (“rv:11”).
  * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1805967
  * Sites affected so far: bestbuy.com, bilibili.com, cvs.com
  * Affected:
    * `"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:110.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0"`
  * Unaffected:
    * `'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/110.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'`
  * Sites think Firefox’s “rv:11” means IE11.
  * [IE11 UAs](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/the-latest-user-agent/internet-explorer)
    * Internet Explorer 10 = `“Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; Trident/6.0)”`
    * Internet Explorer 11 = `“Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko”`
  * Chris will follow up with the Firefox webcompat team, asking if we need a general solution instead of adding interventions for individual sites.

* UA-CH
  * [chris] I’m still prototyping the navigator.userAgentData API for Firefox in my spare time. Slow progress and no ETA.
    * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1750143
  * Mike to take an AI to file a bug / investigate Google Business sites (like https://steakhouse-319.business.site/) using the deprecated `FullVersion`.
  * Mike is in discussion with some internal teams to migrate from deprecated FullVersion to Full-Version-List.
  * Chrome’s UA-CH implementation exposes Linux kernel version
    * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1381304
    * Mike will fix to return an empty string (per the spec):
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4005183
* Publish minutes to https://github.com/whatwg/compat/tree/main/uastring/minutes?
  * Latest minutes are 2022-06-24.
  * Mike made some progress - to finish locally and push.
