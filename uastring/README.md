# User Agent String Reduction / Freezing Discussions

We are meeting once a month to document and determine the issues on reducing/freezing the browser User Agent strings. We are mostly focusing on `navigator.UserAgent` JavaScript property and the `User-Agent` HTTP header. If you would like to participate, please join us.
